# Background
3D points cloud data is widely used in the industry to represent shapes in the real world. Compared with the 3D grids, format of point like (x, y, z) is more intuitive and compatible with mathematics. Not to mention that 3D points data is much easier to store and read. Deep learning tasks on 3d points data mainly focus on object classfication and segmentation. One popular model that is used currently to solve these tasks is the PointNet, which trained a permutation invariant model on set of points. However, a set of points could also be seen as a graph. In this project, we will explore the use of Graph Neural Network (GNN) on 3d Points cloud classfication and comapre its performance with the PointNet.
